### Notes
Xcode has a lot of bugs and I was almost not able to work on my assignment. Luckily, I was able to get Xcode working before the deadline. I wish I could have polished it more if I had the time, but Xcode was not on my side.

### Notes
Loading this app was very hard to do, since I was getting errors with the URL not loading properly even though I was doing it properly. As a result, I had to find a work-around, and long behold, I found one!
